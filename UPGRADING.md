# Upgrade from 1.x to 2.0

ResetPasswordBundle now requires PHP `8.3`+ & Symfony `6.4.5`+

## ResetPasswordHelperInterface

- The `$resetRequestLifetime` argument for `generateResetToken()` must exist in 
classes that implement the interface.

```diff
- public function generateResetToken(object $user/* , ?int $resetRequestLifetime = null */): ResetPasswordToken;
+ public function generateResetToken(object $user, ?int $resetRequestLifetime = null): ResetPasswordToken;
```

## ResetPasswordHelper

- Class became `@final` in `v1.22.0` and in `v2.0.0` the `@final` annotation was 
replaced with the `final` class keyword. Extending this class is not allowed.

## ResetPasswordRemoveExpiredCommand

- Class became `@final` in `v1.22.0` and in `v2.0.0` the `@final` annotation was
    replaced with the `final` class keyword. Extending this class is not allowed.
